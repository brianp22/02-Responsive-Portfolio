# 02-Responsive-Portfolio

## Overview

This is a portfolio created by Brian Prickril to showcase his stunning web applications for the purpose of gaining employment as a web developer after or during the Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp. It utilizes bootstrap elements to make it responsive to different screen sizes.

## About me

This is an area where you can read a bit about Brian and his story. As you can tell, this is a quote from one of his favorite movies, Austin Powers, where Dr. Evil describes his childhood.  This is not Brian's real life story, but it is intended to provide some levity while grading these homeworks. Your welcome (?).

## Portfolio

This page displays my applications. They are static at the moment, but in the future they will take you on glorious adventures.

## Contact

This page is for contacting Brian for any reason at all, but hopefully to give him a job where he can work fully remote and move to Hawaii. Aloha.
